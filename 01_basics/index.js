// Topic - 1, ---- VARIABLES ----

// variables is just like storing a data in a container, that's called variables.
// three types of variables:- const, let, var.
// var:- It's a old way and didn't advised to use more.
// const:- It's for values that don't change or reassignable.
// let:- modern way, can be changed but not reassignable.

var namee = "john doe";
let email = "john@google.com";
const password = "1234";

gender = "male"; // you can store values like this too but it's not a good practice or suggested.

console.table([namee, email, password, gender]);
